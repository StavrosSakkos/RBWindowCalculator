# RBWindowCalculator
Logs into the account panel, scraps the raidboss list, calculates the rb window and prints the status and the window of each rb. (Using Selenium)

Obviously, it works only for that specific account panel (/server). It works as it is.
It took me 30m-1h to create it so .. Consider this as an example only.

Requirements : username, password (in order to log into the account panel ) and link (in order to get the boss status)
